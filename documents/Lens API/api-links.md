# Public API

## Mumbai Testnet

Testnet is the protocol deployed to Mumbai but you _cannot_ whitelist any modules.

This points to the [Deployed Testnet Contract Addresses](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/deployed-contract-addresses#mumbai-testnet-addresses).

## Mumbai Sandbox

Sandbox is the protocol deployed to Mumbai but you _can_ whitelist any modules you want. The API supports this, and can be done using the `UnknownModules` properties. This allows you to test your modules out and still use the API.

## Polygon Mainnet

This points to the [Deployed Mainnet Contract Addresses](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/deployed-contract-addresses#polygon-mainnet-addresses).

# Playground

If you want to just go and play around with the queries go and jump onto the playground and have some fun. This is a great way to learn about how the API has been structured.
