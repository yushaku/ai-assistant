We have been working closely with the fantastic XMTP to get E2EE DMs into the lens. They have now applied it to lenster but the standards are set to allow any lens app to inherit it.

We will expose this logic in our LENS SDK once an official one is supported. This will abstract all of this way for you and we will be building call features on top of XMTP core features. Stay tuned!

If you wish to hook it into one of your lens powers apps today go and check out the guides [here](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/encrypted-dms) and [here](https://xmtp.to/lens-quickstart)
