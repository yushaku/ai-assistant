Publications are the posts, comments and mirrors that a profile posts. You can read more in-depth about what publications are [here](doc:publication).

Make sure you read about the [Metadata standards](doc:metadata-standards) we have set for all publications to conform to. 

Note: if a publication does not conform to these standards we will not index the publication. These are the guidelines set for the API; the protocol itself does not validate these guidelines. Building a standard allows compatibility for all kinds of projects, so we advise sticking to the standards.  If you found that there is anything missing, just get in touch. 

Our metadata standards can be extended so any suggestions are always welcome.
