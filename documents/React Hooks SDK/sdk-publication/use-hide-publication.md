`useHidePublication` is a React hook that allows you to hide a publication an active profile owns.

```typescript
const { hide, isPending } = useHidePublication();
```



> ðŸ“˜ Important to know
> 
> Once you publish something on-chain you can not remove it. 
> 
> Hiding publication only hides it from the API's storage, it **does not** do anything on-chain.
> 
> This is just a nice way to allow users to "delete" publication by hiding content and media which was uploaded for it. 
> 
> You must own the publication to hide it, if you want to report someone else publication there is a separarate hook called `[useReportPublication](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/use-report-publication)`.
> 
> Refer to the API documention to get more information about how hiding works: <https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/hide-publication>

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  PublicationFragment,
  useHidePublication,
  isPublicationOwnedByMe,

  publication: PublicationFragment;
};

export function HidePublication({ publication }: HidePublicationProps) {
  const { hide, isPending } = useHidePublication();

  if (!isPublicationOwnedByMe(publication)) {
    return <p>Can't hide publication that's not owned by you</p>;
  }

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => await hide(publication)}
      disabled={isPending || publication.hidden}
