`useCreatePost` is a React Hook that lets you create a post for a Profile you own.

```typescript
const { execute, error, isPending } = useCreatePost({ publisher, upload });
```

## Usage

Define an `upload` function that conforms to the signature:

```typescript upload.ts
export const upload = (data: unknown): Promise<string> => {
  const serialized = JSON.stringify(data);
  
  const url = // upload serialized to a public location
        
  return url;
}
```

> Check the [web-wagmi](https://github.com/lens-protocol/lens-sdk/tree/main/examples/web-wagmi) example in the Lens SDK monorepo. There is an example `upload` function that uses [Bundlr](https://github.com/Bundlr-Network) to upload the file to Aerwave.

You can then wire the `useCreatePost` into your _composer_ component:

```typescript
import { ContentFocus, CollectPolicyType, ProfileOwnedByMeFragment, ReferencePolicy, useCreatePost } from '@lens-protocol/react';
import { upload } from './upload'

function Composer({ profile }: { profile: ProfileOwnedByMeFragment }) {
  const { execute: create, error, isPending } = useCreatePost({ publisher: profile, upload });

  const onSubmit = async (content: string) => {
    await create({
      content,
      contentFocus: ContentFocus.TEXT,
      locale: 'en',
      collect: {
        type: CollectPolicyType.NO_COLLECT
      },
      reference: {
        type: ReferencePolicy.ANYBODY
      }
    });
  };
  // ...
}
```

You can then pass the `onSubmit` handler to your form

## Reference

### `useCreatePost(args)`

Call `useCreatePost` in the component responsible for submitting the user's input.

```typescript
function Composer({ profile }) {
  const { execute, error, isPending  } = useCreatePost({ publisher, upload });
  // ...
}
```

#### Parameters

- `upload` the user-defined upload function. Must conform to the `(data: unknown) => Promise<string>` signature. It receives a JS Object (safe for serialization) and should return the public URL where the JSON file has been saved. The file must be served as `Content-Type: application/json`. It's the function's responsibility to serialize, upload and return the file URL.
- `publisher` this is the author profile of the new post. It must be a profile owned by the authenticated `Signer` (see [useWalletLogin](doc:use-wallet-login)) as it is returned by [`useActiveProfile`](doc:use-active-profile) or [`useProfilesOwnedByMe`](doc:use-profiles-owned-by-me) hooks.

#### Returns

Returns an object with:

- `create`: a function you can use to initiate the creation of a new post.
- `isPending`: a boolean notifying you when the operation is still in progress.
- `error`: any error that might occur in normal operating conditions will be returned via this property. Default value `null`.

### `execute` function

You can use the `execute` function to initiate the process that leads to a new post.

#### Parameters

It accepts a complex object with all the required configurations. The TS definition will help you to know what configuration to provide and when.

```typescript
{
  profileId: profile.id,
  content?: string,
  contentFocus: ContentFocus,
  locale: string,
  collect: CollectPolicy,
  reference: ReferencePolicy
}
```

where `locale` is a subset of the Locale Identifiers specification. See the full specification [here](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/metadata-standards#locale---required).

> ðŸ“˜ Pro tip
> 
> Use the TypeScript definition to navigate the possible values for each field and subfields. The type definition provided will guide you through the dependency rules of the [Lens Publication Metadata v2](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure) so you don't have to know them.

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise<void>` that you can use to sync with the state of your component. For example you can clear the content of any text input field when such promise resolves.
